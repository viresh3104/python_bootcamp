a = 5
b = 5
print (a+b)
# here a and b are integeres
c = "5"
d = "5"
print(c+d)
# here c and d are strings, so firstly we have to convert this into integer
print(int(c)+int(d))
# this typecasting is known as explicit typecasting

# implicit typecasting means python doing it automatically , we dont have to give command to it
e = 1.6
f = 10
print(e+f)
# here python convrts lower data type to higher means int to float and ans is given in float
